Once we finish the bone structure of the website
–(less important) browserconfig.xml: create tiles for IE11

<!-- Yash Note: 
  I feel like the design creates a great first impression for when the user enters the page. But when the user scrolls down on this home page, the page loses its initial vibe. We should consider adding small designs around the "About Us" and "Initiatives" text, like how Spark SC did theirs.
