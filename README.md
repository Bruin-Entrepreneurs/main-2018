# main-2018
The 2018 version of bruinentrepreneurs.org

TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE WEBSITE:
–Push it to the master branch to the repository. And if you plan on changing the main file name for any reason you have to change it in index.php i had to deploy it as a php app as opposed to a static site. Contact Rahul for further info.


Once we finish the bone structure of the website
–(less important) browserconfig.xml: create tiles for IE11
–Natasha:
––the nav bar texts are supposed to be centered in the darker blue when hovered over
––add the other 2 pics on the get involved page
––make the quotation boxes blue
––make the vehicles move slower
––something's up with the bottom: there's a white gap there
––make the circles align left overall instead of being centered (i.e. for the initiatives and the team)
––On the home page, clicking icons should redirect to the what we do page instead of the events website
–Make sure everyone's majors and minors are correct
–Yash: I'm having trouble opening the website. It takes about 10 seconds (of a blank screen) to load
-marketing advertisement that our new website is up
–Get involved: when hovering over images, small description shows about each image
–Release hover functions for all hover animations
–compress images to make site load faster
<!-- Yash Note: 
  I feel like the design creates a great first impression for when the user enters the page. But when the user scrolls down on this home page, the page loses its initial vibe. We should consider adding small designs around the "About Us" and "Initiatives" text, like how Spark SC did theirs.
